"""Backend for the `echo-voice-timers-card` Lovelace card.

Home Assistant's `TimerManager` is authoritative for every active and
paused timer. This module is the one deliberate boundary that reaches into its
internals for ID-addressed UI actions, kept in its own module with its own
tests.

It layers two things `TimerManager` cannot provide on its own:

  - **Ringing/queued presentation state.** `FINISHED` removes a timer from
    `TimerManager` the instant it fires, before the EchoMuse controller has
    even started the physical alarm — so a card that only reads
    `TimerManager.timers` shows nothing for the entire time a timer is
    actually ringing. The controller pushes `timer.alarm` events describing
    that state (`em_api._post_timer_event` / `em_timers.AlarmSession`);
    `AlarmPresence` holds the latest one per device so the card can still
    show, and dismiss, a timer that finished seconds or minutes ago.
  - **A path back to the EchoMuse device.** Dismissing a ringing alarm has
    to reach the controller, which knows nothing about HA timer IDs and
    addresses devices by its own device id — never the HA device registry
    id `TimerManager` uses. Every `timer.alarm` record carries that EchoMuse
    device id as its top-level `device_id` (see `em_api._post_timer_event`),
    so `AlarmPresence` can map a ringing timer id back to it.

Every hass/registry touch below is behind an injected accessor
(`TimerCardHub`'s constructor arguments), so the orchestration logic is
fully testable without a running Home Assistant — see
`hacs/tests/test_timer_card.py`. `async_setup_timer_card()` is the one
place that wires the real accessors; `async_register_websocket_commands()`
is the thin, deferred-import glue that exposes it over the WebSocket API.

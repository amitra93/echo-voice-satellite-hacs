"""EchoMuse Home Assistant integration package.

Sets up the controller client, the device coordinator, the entity platforms,
and — per docs/design/full-duplex-plan.md Phase 2b — one passive BLE remote scanner per
known device, fed from `ble.adverts` events. There is no ESPHome dependency
anywhere in this package: devices are wholly owned by this integration.

Imports of `homeassistant` (directly or via `.coordinator`/`.ble_scanner`)
are deferred into the function bodies below, deliberately: this file runs
whenever ANY submodule of this package is imported (`.client`, `.audio_frame`,
`.tts_stream`, `.ble` — the pure-logic modules with no HA dependency, tested
without a Home Assistant install), so a top-level `homeassistant` import here
would make even those imports fail outside a real HA environment.

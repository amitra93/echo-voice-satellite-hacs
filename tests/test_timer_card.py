"""echo-voice-timers-card.js — source-shape assertions.

The card has no build step and this repo has no JS test runner, so —
matching the established pattern for this asset — these tests read the
shipped source rather than executing it. `node --check` (run in CI
alongside these) already proves it parses; these pin the card's behavioural
and lifecycle contract.
